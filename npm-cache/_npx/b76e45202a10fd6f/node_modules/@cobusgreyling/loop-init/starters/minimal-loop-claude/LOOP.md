# Loop Configuration — Minimal Triage (Claude Code)

## Active Loops

| Pattern | Cadence | Status | Command |
|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| Daily Triage | 1d | L1 report-only | `/loop 1d Run $loop-triage` |

## Human Gates

- No auto-fix until L2 checklist complete
- All high-risk paths: human review required (see docs/safety.md denylist)

## Worktrees

- Use `isolation: worktree` when spawning implementer sub-agents (L2+).
- One worktree per fix attempt; discard after verifier REJECT.

## Connectors (MCP)

- MCP optional for L1 report-only loops.
- For L2+: GitHub MCP to read CI/issues; scope connectors to read + comment only until trusted.

## Budget

- Max sub-agent spawns per run: 0 (L1)
- Review STATE.md daily
